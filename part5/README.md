How to run.

The following code works on Ubuntu 64 bit. If you want to figure out premake for 32 bit, be my guest, but we've shown it to work for 64 bit only.

To run, cd into derplanner_copy. The make file is autogenerated by premake, but you shouldn't need to touch that to recompile.

To recompile the domain file for hanoi (located at examples/hanoi.domain), in the derplanner_copy directory, use the following command:

$ ./bin/x64/release/derplannerc --out examples examples/hanoi.domain

Then to remake the executable (either because you altered the domain file or the hanoi.main.cpp file), type:

$ make config=release_x64 hanoi

or more simply 

$ make

To run the executable, simply use

./bin/x64/release/hanoi

The initial state, plan of action and elapsed time will be printed to the console.
