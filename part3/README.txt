In order to run, open up myPlanner.py in some sort of text editor.
There should be a line (import sx as sp) where x is some number.
You can vary x from 1 to 4 to run 4 different sokoban problems.
Run myPlanner with "python myPlanner.py" in the command line.
It should print out the map and the final locations of the player,
boxes, and goals along with the number of states visited.
