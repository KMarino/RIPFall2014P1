In part 3 folder, the Sokoban.py file is the implementation. 
It contains the three classes:
	Box - for keeping track of all the objects and their corresponding positions
	Robot - for keeping track of the robot
		* can perform moveBox
	Sokoban - reads the file for the array. scans for the boxes and the robots and sets everything up

	**there is a set of commands at the end of the file for testing. Anyone can play with it and see how it works 


When run from the terminal, it prompts the user
for a number and one can enter any number from 1 to 5 (these numbers are designated for the problems that were
mentioned in the homework assignment)
*** NOTE: '5' file is for testing purposes. One can make changes to it and test the python file.
