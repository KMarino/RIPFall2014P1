Part 4
________________________________________________________________________________________

Part 4 essentially revolves around the two pddl files which are created, Hanoi10 and Hanoi12.

Blacbox planner is not optimal for this problem therefore FF planner is used.

An updated FF planner is created and saved in the directory for the use.

Directions to RUN.

$/bin/user/Desktop/RIPFall2014P1/part4/ff -0 hanoi-domain.pddl -f hanoi10.pddl

By running the above script the steps will be created. However the scripts are already executed and 
the results are saved in the following files
Hanoi10ResultsFF.txt
Hanoi12Results.txt
