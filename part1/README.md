This part requires planners which are needed to be run in a 32 bit linux. 

Hanoi-domain.pddl -- Domain for the Towers of Hanoi
Hanoi2.pddl -- PDDL file needed to be run

The way to run the planner is quite simple:

../pathToPlanners/ff -o hanoi-domain.pddl -f hanoi2.pddl

../pathToPlanners/blackbox -o hanoi-domain.pddl -f hanoi2.pddl
